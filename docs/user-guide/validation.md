## Analyzing Performance
This bias correction method should adjust all streams toward a more realistic but still not perfect value for discharge. 
The following steps help you to analyze how well this method performed in a given area by iteratively running this 
method on the same set of streams but with an increasing number of randomly selected observed data stations being 
excluded each time. The code provided will help you partition your gauge table into randomly selected subsets.
