# Assignment Table

The Assignments Table is the core of the `saber` python package. It is a `pandas` dataframe which is saved to disk as a 
`parquet` file. It has 1 row per subbasin in your hydrologic model. It is generated from the `drain_table`, `gauge_table`, 
and `regulate_table` input files. The table has the following columns:

1. `model_id`: The unique ID of the stream segment. This is the same as the `model_id` in the `drain_table` and `drain_gis`.
2. `downstream_model_id`: The ID of the next downstream reach, used to trace the network programmatically. This comes from the `drain_table`.
3. `strahler_order`: The strahler stream order of each reach. This comes from the `drain_table`.
4. `x`: The x coordinate of the centroid of each subbasin. This comes from the `drain_table`.
5. `y`: The y coordinate of the centroid of each subbasin. This comes from the `drain_table`.
6. `gauge_id`: The unique ID of the gauge contained by the subbasin. This comes from the `gauge_table`. This will be blank for most rows.
7. `regulated_id`: The unique ID of the regulatory structure contained by the subbasin. This comes from the `regulate_table`. This will be blank for most rows.
8. `latitude`: The latitude of each gauge. This comes from the `gauge_table`.
9. `longitude`: The longitude of each gauge. This comes from the `gauge_table`.
10. `cluster_label`: The cluster label of each subbasin. This is used to group subbasins together for calibration. This column is generated by SABER.
